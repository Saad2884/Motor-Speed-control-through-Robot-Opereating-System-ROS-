* The Arduino micro-controllers were programmed with ROS libraries to act as receiver (slave).
* The Raspberry Pi micro-controller was programmed with ROS libraries to act as transmitter (master).
* Sending the command from master to slave using wired communication to control all the slave micro-controller parallelly.
* The command to master from the user were sent wirelessly through ESP 8266 microcontroller's hotspot
